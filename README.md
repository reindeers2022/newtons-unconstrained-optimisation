newtonsMethod.cpp -
this a CPP program in OOPs paradigm that calculates and display iterations for newtons method for unconstrained optimisation problems involving simultaneous equation with multivariable function
LIMITATIONS OF THIS CODE
-works for polynomial eqn of degree of 3 or less
-can take only 2 simultaneous eqn that have only 2 independent variables i.e. m=n=2
-function must not contain product of two variables
-initial approximation (x,y)=(0,0)
